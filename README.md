# Garmin Golf Scripts

This repo was inspired by the [Export Golf Scorecards](https://forums.garmin.com/apps-software/mobile-apps-web/f/garmin-connect-web/128000/export-golf-scorecards/1229772#1229772) thread on the Garmin forums and the scripts by WillNorthYork for downloading and converting *your* Garmin golf data to JSON/CSV.  Since Garmin doesn't offer APIs for accessing one's own golf data, this really is the only approach for getting your data out of Garmin.

I've modified the [original code](https://forums.garmin.com/apps-software/mobile-apps-web/f/garmin-connect-web/128000/export-golf-scorecards/1229772#1229772) to download club data and shot-by-shot data for those users of Garmin's CT10 shot trackers.
